# Cybersecurity Internship Projects
This projects was developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I dedicated my efforts to advancing my skills in cybersecurity tool development. This project reflects the knowledge and experience I acquired. The objective of this project is to efficiently create custom tools necessary for ethical hacking.
# Projects Overview:

## 1. Caesar Cipher
Description: This project involves creating an implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique. It includes both encryption and decryption capabilities.

Technologies: Python

Skills: Cryptography, String manipulation
## 2. Pixel Manipulation
Description: This program manipulates image pixels to achieve steganography, allowing the embedding and extraction of hidden messages within image files.

Technologies: Python, PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Skills: Steganography, Image processing
## 3. Password Strength Checker
Description: A tool designed to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, character diversity, and common patterns. It provides feedback and suggestions for enhancing password security.

Technologies: Python

Skills: Password security, Regular expressions
## 4. Keylogger
Description: This educational project involves creating a keylogger to demonstrate how keylogging functions and how it can be detected and prevented. The keylogger captures keystrokes and saves them to a file.

Technologies: Python

Skills: Ethical hacking, Security awareness
## 5. Network Packet Analyzer

Description: This project involves developing a network packet analyzer tool that captures and examines network packets. It aids in understanding network protocols and monitoring network traffic for any suspicious activity.

Technologies: Python, Scapy

Skills: Network security, Packet analysis
